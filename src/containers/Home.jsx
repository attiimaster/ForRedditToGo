              <h1>ðŸ’¡ Quick explanation</h1>
              <p>Listen to Reddit, while walking, cooking or whatever. Reddit To Go is a web application intended for portable devices that leverages the <b>Text to Speech</b> Feature of modern browsers to read out reddit threads. For now please consider using <b>Google Chrome</b> or <b>Mozilla Firefox</b> to ensure the best possible user experience.</p>
              <p><b>Please note:</b> This is not a substitute for browsing reddit. Although threads with links, images and videos can be accessed, it's main focus are textbased threads.</p>
              <p>Features like messaging, mod features, etc are not included for now because I do not want to create another reddit client, but a complementary web service one can use if needed.</p>
              <p>If you want to suggest or contribute a feature, feel free to contact me here or on github.</p>

              <h1>ðŸ‘€ Demo</h1>
              <p>When reading a thread a user may use the synthesizer buttons to control the speech synthesis. Pressing <b>PLAY</b> will read the thread from beginning to end. You may skip or relisten to individual posts by using the <b>BACK</b> / <b>SKIP</b> buttons respectively. <b>STOP</b> will halt and cancel all queued messages.</p>
              <p>You may also select a <b>READMODE</b>. For now there is <b>STANDARD</b> and <b>TOP COMMENTS ONLY</b>. <b>STANDARD</b> will read the thread as is with all comments including some (or all, depending on the volume) high rated replies, while <b>TOP COMMENTS ONLY</b> only reads, well, top comments.</p>
              <p>Comments get initialized with the phrase: <i>USERNAME comments...</i> while replies get initialized with <i>USERNAME replies...</i></p>
