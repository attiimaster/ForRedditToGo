## For Reddit, To Go

Uses text to speech so I can listen to Reddit while doing things.

-------

**Note:** This is a work in progress and features may not function as intended. 


##### Features to be implemented for MVP: 
 - fetch more content when user reaches bottom of current feed
 - basic frontpage
 - figure out synth (readmode or sth);


##### Features to improve for MVP:

**search feature:**  
 - sorting options
 - search subreddit

##### Features that could make sense:
 - save threads
