## For Reddit, To Go

Uses text to speech so I can listen to Reddit while doing things.

-------

**Note:** This is a work in progress and features may not function as intended. 

**Features to be implemented for MVP:** 
 - save threads
 - sort subreddits and threads
 - skip feature (?)

**Features to improve:**
*search feature:* 
 - adjust number of results 
 - sorting options
 - search subreddit

*synth controller:*
 - implement pauses between different sections (comments, post),
 - skip feature
 - announcements (eg: `u/${user} writes`)
