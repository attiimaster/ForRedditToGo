## For Reddit, To Go

Uses text to speech so I can listen to Reddit while doing things.

-------

**Note:** This is a work in progress and features may not function as intended. 


##### Features to be implemented for MVP: 
 - fetch more content when user reaches bottom of current feed
 - figure out comments and replies (max chars: ~ 32000)
 - synth: work out the details
 - basic frontpage


##### Features to improve for MVP:

**sort feature:** 
 - add sort to search

**search feature:**  
 - adjust number of results 
 - sorting options
 - search subreddit

**synth controller:** 
 - implement pauses between different sections (comments, post),
 - skip feature
 - read answers
 - announcements (eg: `u/${user} writes`)


##### Features that could make sense:
 - save threads
