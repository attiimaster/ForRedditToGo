## For Reddit, To Go

Uses text to speech so I can listen to Reddit while doing things.

-------

**Note:** This is a work in progress and features may not function as intended. 

**Features to be implemented for MVP:** 
 - save threads
 - search subreddit and all
 - sort subreddits and threads
 - skip feature (?)
