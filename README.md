-------

Reddit To Go is a web application intended for portable devices that leverages the Text to Speech features of modern browsers to read out reddit threads. For now please consider using the latest version of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox to ensure functionality and the best possible user experience.

RedditToGo fits some subreddits more than others. Where it excels are textbased threads and comment trees. Accessing threads that share images, videos or links is possible, but for now you will have to follow the link to the original source to consume it.

Features like messaging, mod features, etc are not included for now, because this is meant to be a complementary service one can use if needed.

If you want to suggest or contribute a feature, feel free to contact me on my page or on github.
How to use / main features

When reading a thread a user may use the synthesizer buttons to control the speech synthesis. Pressing PLAY will read the thread from beginning to end. You may skip or relisten to individual posts by using the BACK / SKIP buttons respectively. STOP will halt and cancel all queued messages.

You may also select a READMODE. For now there is STANDARD and TOP CMNTS. STANDARD will read the thread as is with all comments including some (or all, depending on the volume) high rated replies, while TOP CMNTS only reads out comments without reading out any replies.

Comments get initialized with the phrase: USERNAME comments... while replies get initialized with USERNAME replies...

If you find any bugs or have suggestions please feel free to contact me on my page or on github. I built this project for myself initially, but figured some people might find it useful. I would be stoked to improve For Reddit, To Go for others aswell.
