## For Reddit, To Go

Uses text to speech so I can listen to Reddit while doing things.

-------

**Note:** This is a work in progress and features may not function as intended. 


##### Features to be implemented for MVP: 
 - fetch more content when user reaches bottom of current feed
 - check different reddit posts (link, image, video, text)
 - more replies (get complete comment tree)


##### Features to improve:

**search feature:**  
 - sorting options
 - search subreddit


##### Features that could make sense:
 - save threads


Notes for self:
Home, Sub, Search are redundant: each has handleSort, that is like the componentDidMount function
